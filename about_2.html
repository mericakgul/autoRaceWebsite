            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>To quote https://24hoursoflemons.com/:</p>
            <p>“Racing shouldn’t just be for rich idiots. Racing should be for all idiots.”</p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series aspires to make the excitement of competitive racing events on iconic Northern
                California racetracks available to all enthusiasts without the costs or risks of wheel-to-wheel racing.</p>
            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series will hold at least one event per month on a track such as Sonoma Raceway,
                Thunderhill Raceway, or WeatherTech Raceway at Laguna Seca. Full safety equipment is required, and
                your car must pass technical inspection before you can compete.</p>
