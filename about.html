            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To quote https://24hoursoflemons.com/:</p>
            <p>“Racing shouldn’t just be for rich idiots. Racing should be for all idiots.”</p>
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series aspires to make the excitement of competitive racing events on iconic Northern California racetracks available to all enthusiasts without the costs or risks of wheel-to-wheel racing.</p>
            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series will hold at least one event per month on a track such as Sonoma Raceway, Thunderhill Raceway, or WeatherTech Raceway at Laguna Seca. Full safety equipment is required, and your car must pass technical inspection before you can compete.</p>
