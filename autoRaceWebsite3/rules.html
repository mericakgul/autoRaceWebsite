        <h1 class="main-title">TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</h1>
        <p class="intro">We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</p>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
        <p> Motorsports are inherently dangerous&#8228; These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to
            participants&#8218; spectators or others&#8228; You can reduce risk by driving well&#8218; properly using
            superior safety gear&#8218; paying attention&#8218; and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials&#8228;
            Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under
            elevated acceleration&#8218; braking and cornering forces&#8228; Drivers must have a Technical Inspection
            &#40;Tech&#41; Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official&#8228;</p>
        <p> Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection
            that current technology can provide&#8228; It is recommended that seats&#8218; restraint systems&#8218; roll
            bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible&#8228;</p>
        <p> National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these
            Rules&#8228; In these cases&#8218; there are two additional Safety Levels&#8228;</p>
